Follow the directions below, then use the following to run the script:

# chromecastslack
Report your playing songs to slack!

This script will look for active Chromecasts in your LAN, then report the currently played song to a slack channel of your choosing.

I tested this script with Python 3.5. Other versions (3.0 and up) should work, but haven't been tested.

## Setup
1. Have a working Chromecast in your LAN, playing music from your favorite source (Spotify, Soundcloud, ...).
1. [Create a bot user](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) in your Slack account.
1. Install *chromecastslack* on any computer in your LAN.
1. Use the API token (*xoxb-a-b*) to execute the bot.

## Installing
```
git clone git@github.com:sh0oki/chromecastslack.git
cd chromecastslack
pip3.5 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
SLACKBOT_TOKEN=xoxb-my-token python3.5 listener.py
```
Use your favorite init script to execute the script after restart.
